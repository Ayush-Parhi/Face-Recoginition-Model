# Face-Recoginition-Model
A face recognition model based on the kNN algorithm and developed in python language.
There are two python files in this repository namely : face data.py and face recognition.py .
The face data file stores the face for the recognition. The face image is processed 20 times and each time it reads the pixels and stores it.
The face recognition file just matches the face in front of the camera with the previously stored face in the face data file and if it matches the name of the person is indicated at the top left of the face.
